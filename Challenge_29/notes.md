- Repo is clonned
- But this time there is nothing useful under `README.md`
    + Can see the 'password' section but only X's - masked
- Lets read the previous commits + diffs it might contain the details 
    + `git log -p README.md` - shows the last commits with diffs
    + And can see the key ðŸ”‘ under the diffs
